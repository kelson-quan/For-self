    Improving If(){} Else{} statements with Operators
        Check to see if a variable exists:
            if (myVariable) -This checks if the variable exists
            This is true because the variable exists and doesn't have a false value. 
                -False values: 0, empty string, null, undefined, or Not a Number
        Shorthand-circuit evaluation:
            You can use a variable and the || operator together. for a shortened if else statement
                ex. let defaultName = username || 'stranger';
                If username does not exist the variable will be stranger.
        Ternary Operator:
            Use to shorten Boolean if/else statements
                ex. long: 
                    let isNightTime = true;
                    if (isNightTime) {
                    console.log('Yes');
                    } else {
                    console.log('No');
                    }
                    short: 
                    isNightTime ? console.log('Yes') : console.log('No');
                ex 2. 
                    walkSignal === 'Walk' ? console.log('You may walk!') : console.log('Do not walk!'); 
            In the example above:
            The condition, isNightTime, is provided before the ?.
            Two expressions follow the ? and are separated by a colon :.
            If the condition evaluates to true, the first expression executes.
            If the condition evaluates to false, the second expression executes.
            Like if...else statements, ternary operators can be used for conditions which evaluate to true or false.

    
    Activities
    1.
        Summary: create a if else statement with a AND statement
            1. Create a variable named mood, set it to 'sleepy'
            2. create a variable named tirednessLevel, set it to '6'
            3. Let's create an if...else statement that checks if mood is 'sleepy' and tirednessLevel is greater than 8.
            4. If both conditions evaluate to true, then console.log() the string 'time to sleep'. Otherwise, we should console.log() 'not bed time yet'.
            5. After you press "Run", play around with the || operator and the ! operator! What happens if you negate the value of the entire statement with ! and switch to || instead of &&?

        Solution: 
            let mood = 'sleepy';
            let tirednessLevel = 6;

            if (mood === 'sleepy' && tirednessLevel > 8) {
            console.log('time to sleep');
            } else {
            console.log('not bed time yet')
            }

Else/If Statements
    Introduction: 
        We can add more conditions to our if...else with an else if statement. The else if statement allows for more than two possible outcomes. You can add as many else if statements as youâ€™d like, to make more complex conditionals!
        ex. 
            (stopLight === 'red') {
            console.log('Stop!');
            } else if (stopLight === 'yellow') {
            console.log('Slow down.');
            } else if (stopLight === 'green') {
            console.log('Go!');
            } else {
            console.log('Caution, unknown!');
            }
        The else if statements allow you to have multiple possible outcomes. if/else if/else statements are read from top to bottom, so the first condition that evaluates to true from the top to bottom is the block that gets executed.

        In the example above, since stopLight === 'red' evaluates to false and stopLight === 'yellow' evaluates to true, the code inside the first else if statement is executed. The rest of the conditions are not evaluated. If none of the conditions evaluated to true, then the code in the else statement would have executed.
    
Switch Statements
    Introduction: 
        Problem: we have a series of conditions checking for a value that matches a groceryItem variable. Our code works fine, but imagine if we needed to check 100 different values! Having to write that many else if statements sounds like a pain!

        Solution: A switch statement provides an alternative syntax that is easier to read and write. A switch statement looks like this:
            let groceryItem = 'papaya';

            switch (groceryItem) {
            case 'tomato':
                console.log('Tomatoes are $0.49');
                break;
            case 'lime':
                console.log('Limes are $1.49');
                break;
            case 'papaya':
                console.log('Papayas are $1.29');
                break;
            default:
                console.log('Invalid item');
                break;
            }
        Format: 
            switch (true variable to be compared) {
                case 'variable comparison':
                    action;
                    break;
                case 'variable comparison':
                    action;
                    break;
            }
        Instead of a giant if/else if statement. We just say in the case that the variable is _____ do this.
    Activity: 
        1. Create a magic eight ball that console.logs 8 possible responses.
        2. Use a switch function. 
    Solution: 
        var randomNumber = Math.floor(Math.random() * 8);
        var eightBall = "";
        eightBall = randomNumber;
        switch (eightBall) {
            case 0:
                console.log('It is certain');
                break;
            case 1:
                console.log('1');
                break;
            case 2:
                console.log('2');
                break;
            case 3:
                console.log('3');
                break;
            case 4:
                console.log('4');
                break;
            case 5:
                console.log('5');
                break;
            case 6:
                console.log('6');
                break;
            case 7:
                console.log('7');
                break;
        }
    Activity: 
        Race Day
            Codecademy's annual race is just around the corner! This year, we have a lot of participants. You have been hired to write a program that will register runners for the race and give them instructions on race day.

            As a timeline, registration would look like this: registration-timeline

            Here's how our registration works. There are adult runners (over 18 years of age) and youth runners (under 18 years of age). They can register early or late. Runners are assigned a race number and start time based on their age and registration.

            Race number:

            Early adults receive a race number at or above 1000.
            All others receive a number below 1000.
            Start time:

            Adult registrants run at 9:30 am or 11:00 am.
            Early adults run at 9:30 am.
            Late adults run at 11:00 am.
            Youth registrants run at 12:30 pm (regardless of registration).
    Solution: 
        let raceNumber = Math.floor(Math.random() * 1000);
                <!-- Set runner Parameters, can be any -->
        let runnerEarly = true;
        let runnerAge = 26;
        <!-- Make starting random number -->
        if (runnerEarly === true && runnerAge > 18) {
        raceNumber += 1000;
        } 
        <!-- Run the test to print -->
        if (runnerAge > 18 && runnerEarly === true) {
        console.log("Your race will start at 9:30 am and your race number is " + raceNumber);
        } else if (runnerEarly === false && runnerAge > 18) {
        console.log("Your race will start at 11:00 am and your race number is " + raceNumber);
        } else if (runnerAge<18) {
        console.log("Your race will start at 12:30 pm and your race number is " + raceNumber);
        } else {
        console.log("See registration desk");
        }
        

        
            

Review: 
Review
    An if statement checks a condition and will execute a task if that condition evaluates to true.
    if...else statements make binary decisions and execute different code blocks based on a provided condition.
    We can add more conditions using else if statements.
    Comparison operators, including <, >, <=, >=, ===, and !== can compare two values.
    The logical and operator, &&, or "and", checks if both provided expressions are truthy.
    The logical operator ||, or "or", checks if either provided expression is truthy.
    The bang operator, !, switches the truthiness and falsiness of a value.
    The ternary operator is shorthand to simplify concise if...else statements.
    A switch statement can be used to simplify the process of writing multiple else if statements. The break keyword stops the remaining cases from being checked and executed in a switch statement.

Chapter 2: We Out Here Trying to Function
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
An Introduction 
    In JavaScript, there are many ways to create a function. One way to create a function is by using a function declaration. Just like how a variable declaration binds a value to a variable name, a function declaration binds a function to a name, or an identifier. Take a look at the anatomy of a function declaration below:
   
    A function declaration consists of:
        The function keyword.
        The name of the function, or its identifier, followed by parentheses.
        A function body, or the block of statements required to perform a specific task, enclosed in the functionâ€™s curly brackets, { }.
        A function declaration is a function that is bound to an identifier, or name. In the next exercise we'll go over how to run the code inside the function body.

    We should also be aware of the hoisting feature in JavaScript which allows access to function declarations before they're defined.

    Take a look at example of hoisting:

    console.log(greetWorld()); // Output: Hello, World!

    function greetWorld() {
    console.log('Hello, World!');
    }
    Notice how hoisting allowed greetWorld() to be called before the greetWorld() function was defined! Since hoisting isn't considered good practice, we simply want you to be aware of this feature.

Functions with Parameters and Arguments
    So far, the functions we've created execute a task without an input. However, some functions can take inputs and use the inputs to perform a task. When declaring a function, we can specify its parameters. Parameters allow functions to accept input(s) and perform a task using the input(s). We use parameters as placeholders for information that will be passed to the function when it is called.
Function Expressions
    Function expressions are not named and are often put into const variables.
        ex. const calculateArea = function(width,height) { const area = height * width; return area;}
Function Expressions: Shorthand Arrow Functions
    ES6 introduced arrow function syntax, a shorter way to write functions by using the special "fat arrow" () => notation.

    Arrow functions remove the need to type out the keyword function every time you need to create a function. Instead, you first include the parameters inside the ( ) and then add an arrow => that points to the function body surrounded in { } like this:
        Replace function () {} with () => {}
        ex.
            const rectangleArea = (width, height) => {
            let area = width * height;
            return area
            }
Function Expressions: Shorthand Arrows and Return shorthand
    Shorthand to replace a long writter return function
        ex.
            const sum = (number) =>               const sum = number => number + number;
                const sum = number + number; --->
                return sum;
            }
Scoping: 
    In this lesson, you learned about scope and how it impacts the accessibility of different variables.

    Scope is the idea in programming that some variables are accessible/inaccessible from other parts of the program.
    Blocks are statements that exist within curly braces {}.
    Global scope refers to the context within which variables are accessible to every part of the program.
    Global variables are variables that exist within global scope.
    Block scope refers to the context within which variables that are accessible only within the block they are defined.
    Local variables are variables that exist within block scope.
    Global namespace is the space in our code that contains globally scoped information.
    Scope pollution is when too many variables exist in a namespace or variable names are reused.
    As you continue your coding journey, remember to use best practices when declaring your variables! Scoping your variables tightly will ensure that your code has clean, organized, and modular logic.

Review:
    Give yourself a pat on the back, you just navigated through functions!

    In this lesson, we covered some important concepts about functions:
    * A function is a reusable block of code that groups together a sequence of statements to perform a specific task.
    * A function declaration : Diagram showing the syntax of a function declaration
    * A parameter is a named variable inside a function's block which will be assigned the value of the argument passed in when the function is invoked: JavaScript syntax for declaring a function with parameters
    * To call a function in your code: Diagram showing the syntax of invoking a function
    * ES6 introduces new ways of handling arbitrary parameters through default parameters which allow us to assign a default value to a parameter in case no argument is passed into the function.
    * To return a value from a function, we use a return statement.
    * To define a function using function expressions: defining a function expression
    * To define a function using arrow function notation: 
    * Function definition can be made concise using concise arrow notation: comparing single line and multiline arrow functions
    * It's good to be aware of the differences between function expressions, arrow functions, and function declarations. As you program more in JavaScript, you'll see a wide variety of how these function types are used.



Activities
    1. Why does this return undefined?
        function rectangleArea(width, height) {
        let area = width * height 
        }
        console.log(rectangleArea(5, 7)) // 
    2. Create a function expression that tells you to water the plants if it is Wednesday. Start with a constant variable/
        Solution: 
            const plantNeedsWater = function(day){ 
            if (day === 'Wednesday') {
            return true;
            } else {return false;}
            }
            plantNeedsWater('Tuesday');
            console.log(plantNeedsWater('Tuesday'));
